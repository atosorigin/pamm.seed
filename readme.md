PAMM
==

PAMM is an opinionated architecture optimized for data driven applications.  Together with its sister project JAMM (integration TBA) offers a full enterprise stack.  It is important to understand that PAMM is not a framework and there is no API to force developers to code in a certain manner.  What PAMM offers is a ready made architecture that gives a head start for the development of typical digital/WEB applications.
